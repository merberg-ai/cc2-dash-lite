**cc2-dash-lite** is a lightweight local dashboard and portal shell for the **Elegoo Centauri Carbon 2 / CC2** ecosystem. It gives you a clean LAN dashboard, printer discovery and pairing, camera relay/fanout, a stock Elegoo portal bridge, optional Ollama-powered visual monitoring, feedback-aware AI review tools, kiosk mode, file/history helpers, CANVAS filament controls, and a themeable mobile-friendly UI.

It is designed for a Raspberry Pi-style board sitting on your trusted home network. Think: printer-room companion dashboard, not enterprise print-farm overlord.

> [!WARNING]
> **Private, home, hobbyist use only.** cc2-dash-lite is not designed, tested, or recommended for production environments, commercial print farms, safety-critical workflows, unattended remote operation, or any situation where missed detection, a failed command, or an incorrect AI result could cause damage. Keep physical access to your printer and use the stock printer controls as the final authority.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an unofficial project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Elegoo, OctoEverywhere, or any printer vendor. Firmware behavior can change. Some stock command paths behave differently across firmware versions.

> [!NOTE]
> In this version, **Portal AI cannot pause, resume, cancel, or otherwise control print jobs automatically**. AI/vision monitoring is advisory only. Manual dashboard controls can still be enabled by the user, but the AI watchdog does not issue pause/cancel commands yet.

## Tested hardware and platform notes

### Tested

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W running Raspberry Pi OS-style Linux.

### Expected to work better

- Raspberry Pi 4.
- Raspberry Pi 5.
- Other Debian/Ubuntu-like Linux boxes.
- Small x86 Linux mini-PCs.

A Pi Zero 2 W can run the dashboard, but a Pi 4 or Pi 5 is a much nicer target if you plan to use camera relay, logs, browser clients, and Ollama-related network calls heavily. Ollama itself should usually run on a stronger LAN machine, not on the Zero 2 W.

### Windows

Windows has **not** been tested. The backend is Python/FastAPI, so it might run with manual setup, but the included helper scripts, service installation, and process-management assumptions are aimed at Raspberry Pi OS / Linux / systemd.

---

## Feature overview

### Local dashboard

- FastAPI backend.
- Plain CSS and vanilla JavaScript frontend.
- Mobile-first responsive layout.
- Themeable UI.
- Collapsible dashboard sections.
- Saved dashboard accordion state per printer.
- Compact build/version chips in the header.
- `/health` and `/api/version` diagnostics.

### Printer discovery and pairing

- UDP Centauri discovery using Elegoo method `7000`.
- Verified-printer scan filtering so unrelated LAN devices are not shown as printer candidates.
- Manual printer add when discovery is blocked.
- Alphanumeric printer PIN/access-code fields.
- No prefilled default PIN.
- Printer serial/SN, access code, MQTT host/port, and command permissions stored per printer.

### Dashboard controls

Optional dashboard actions include:

- Light toggle.
- Pause print.
- Resume print.
- Cancel print.
- Camera wake/enable.
- Speed preset selection.
- Manual camera analysis.

Command buttons are controlled by per-printer safety settings. Dangerous commands remain gated so an accidental phone tap does not become a tiny disaster opera.

### Camera relay

- Keeps one upstream MJPEG camera connection to the printer.
- Serves dashboard clients from local relay/fanout endpoints.
- Provides cached latest frame for Portal AI and feedback capture.
- Helps prevent multiple browser tabs and AI checks from dogpiling the printer camera endpoint.

### Portal AI

- Telemetry/rule-based print health checks.
- Optional Ollama vision analysis.
- Local image heuristics for dark frames, contrast, fine-edge/stringing-like changes, and stale/frozen-looking frames.
- Active-print-only monitoring so idle printers do not waste cycles or create meaningless warnings.
- Advisory-only: no automatic pause/cancel in this version.

### Feedback-aware AI review

- Looks Good / Looks Bad / False Alarm buttons.
- Fresh camera frame capture on feedback click, with cached-frame fallback.
- Feedback interpreted into true positive / false positive / false negative / true negative.
- Same-print suppression for repeated low/severity false alarms.
- Feedback and frame data saved locally for later review/tuning.

### Stock portal bridge

- Bundled stock Elegoo-style portal page.
- Local MQTT-over-WebSocket bridge.
- Fullscreen portal route.
- Portal camera rewrite shim that tries to route embedded camera views through cc2-dash-lite's camera relay.

### File and filament tools

- File Manager can list stock-style printer files, USB files, print history, and video records where firmware supports it.
- Timelapse export/download helpers are included, but printer firmware may not reliably generate/export videos.
- Filament Manager can display and control CANVAS/MMS filament slots using stock command shapes.
- Filament load/unload/edit controls are idle-only.

### Themes

Built-in themes include:

- Octo Dark Blue.
- Amber Terminal.
- Mainsail-ish Dark.
- Carbon Glass.
- Toxic Green Lab.
- Blood Red Terminal.
- Elegoo Dark.
- Klipper Blue.
- OLED Mono.
- Cyberpunk Magenta.
- High Contrast.

Theme preview cards are available in first-run setup and Settings.

## What cc2-dash-lite does not do

This matters, so here it is without the marketing fog machine:

- It does **not** make the printer safe to leave unattended.
- It does **not** replace the stock Elegoo portal.
- It does **not** guarantee failure detection.
- It does **not** automatically pause/cancel prints from AI decisions in this version.
- It does **not** harden your LAN or provide production-grade authentication.
- It does **not** fix firmware features that are broken in the stock portal itself.

Use it as a local dashboard, helper, and experiment platform.

---

## Install from GitHub on Raspberry Pi OS

These instructions assume Raspberry Pi OS, Debian, Ubuntu, or a similar apt-based Linux system.

### 1. Update the Pi and install basic tools

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-venv python3-pip
```

### 2. Clone the repository

Replace the URL below with your actual GitHub repository URL if different:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USER/cc2-dash-lite.git
cd cc2-dash-lite
```

Example if you cloned from your own fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USER/cc2-dash-lite.git
```

### 3. Make helper scripts executable

```bash
chmod +x install.sh run.sh uninstall.sh
```

### 4. Install Python dependencies

```bash
./install.sh
```

The installer will:

1. Check for Python 3.
2. Create `.venv/` if needed.
3. Upgrade `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`.
4. Install packages from `requirements.txt`.
5. Create the local `data/` folder.

Dependencies currently include:

```text
fastapi
httpx
jinja2
paho-mqtt
pydantic
python-multipart
requests
uvicorn[standard]
Pillow
```

---

## Run manually

Start the app:

```bash
./run.sh
```

Open from another device on the same LAN:

```text
http://<pi-ip>:8088/
```

Example:

```text
http://192.168.1.50:8088/
```

To run on a different port:

```bash
CC2_PORT=8090 ./run.sh
```

---

## Install as a systemd service

For always-on use, install cc2-dash-lite as a background service:

```bash
./install.sh --service --port=8088
```

Useful commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl status cc2-dash-lite --no-pager
sudo systemctl restart cc2-dash-lite
sudo systemctl stop cc2-dash-lite
sudo journalctl -u cc2-dash-lite -f
```

The service runs:

```bash
python -m uvicorn cc2_dash_lite.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8088
```

---

## Update from GitHub

From the project folder:

```bash
git pull
./install.sh
```

If installed as a service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart cc2-dash-lite
```

If running manually, stop the old process and restart:

```bash
./run.sh
```

Your local runtime data lives in `data/`. Do not delete it unless you want to reset printers, logs, AI feedback, and settings.

---

## First-run setup

When no valid printer is configured, cc2-dash-lite opens the setup wizard.

Setup flow:

| Step | Purpose |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Find printers using verified Centauri discovery |
| 2 | Add a printer manually if discovery fails |
| 3 | Pick theme and font preferences |
| 4 | Configure LAN access allowlist |
| 5 | Configure Portal AI and optional Ollama vision |
| 6 | Review and launch dashboard |

The scanner only shows devices that answer the expected Centauri discovery probe. Routers, phones, smart plugs, and random LAN web servers should stay hidden.

Printer settings saved during setup:

```text
Printer display name
Printer host/IP
Printer serial/SN
Printer PIN/access code
MQTT port, usually 1883
Default printer selection
Command permission flags
```

---

## Using the dashboard

Primary pages:

| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| **Dash** | Main printer view with status, camera, quick actions, Portal AI, and connection info. |
| **Portal** | Stock Elegoo portal bridge/fallback. |
| **Kiosk** | Camera-first fullscreen display for tablets or spare monitors. |
| **Files** | Optional file/history/timelapse helper page. Hidden by default. |
| **Filament** | Optional CANVAS/MMS filament manager. Hidden by default. |
| **Settings** | Printer Manager, themes, menu visibility, quick actions, access, camera relay, AI settings. |
| **Logs** | Filterable runtime log viewer. |

The **Files**, **Filament**, and **Kiosk** navigation items can be shown or hidden in:

```text
Settings → Menu / Features
```

---

## Printer Manager

Open:

```text
Settings → Printer Manager
```

Available actions:

- Scan for verified Centauri printers.
- Add a printer manually.
- Edit printer name, IP/host, serial, access code, and MQTT port.
- Enable or disable printer entries.
- Choose the default printer.
- Enable/disable normal commands.
- Enable/disable dangerous commands.
- Remove old printer entries.

Command permissions are intentionally separate from pairing. You can monitor a printer while keeping control buttons locked down.

---

## Camera Relay / stream protection

The CC2 camera can get cranky when too many things connect to it directly. The Camera Relay reduces that load.

How it works:

1. cc2-dash-lite opens one upstream MJPEG connection to the printer camera.
2. The latest frame is cached in memory.
3. Browser clients receive a local MJPEG stream from the dashboard server.
4. Portal AI and feedback capture use the cached/latest frame instead of opening extra direct camera connections.
5. The stock portal shim tries to rewrite embedded camera URLs through the relay.

Useful endpoints:

```text
GET  /api/printers/<printer_id>/camera/stream
GET  /api/printers/<printer_id>/camera/snapshot.jpg
GET  /api/printers/<printer_id>/camera/latest.jpg
GET  /api/printers/<printer_id>/camera/status
GET  /api/camera/status
POST /api/printers/<printer_id>/camera/restart
```

Recommended default: relay enabled, start-on-boot enabled, portal rewrites enabled, direct fallback disabled unless debugging.

---

## Kiosk mode

Kiosk mode opens a minimal camera-first page intended for:

- Wall tablet.
- Spare phone.
- Browser tab on a shop monitor.
- Quick glance print display.

It can show:

- Camera relay state.
- Active printer.
- Active file.
- Print state: **IDLE** or **PRINTING**.
- Progress bar and percent.
- Estimated time remaining.
- Portal AI badge.

Settings live under:

```text
Settings → Kiosk Mode
```

The Kiosk nav item can be shown/hidden under:

```text
Settings → Menu / Features
```

---

## Portal AI and Ollama vision

Portal AI combines printer telemetry, local rules, optional camera heuristics, and optional Ollama vision output into an advisory status.

Current behavior:

- Runs only during active print jobs.
- Stands by when the printer is idle.
- Tracks stale status, printer error states, pause/error/fail states, stuck progress, temp sanity, filament status hints, and camera/vision issues.
- Uses Ollama vision only when enabled and when an active print is detected.
- Does not automatically pause/cancel jobs.

Common checks:

- Printer connected/reachable.
- MQTT status freshness.
- Error/fail/emergency/stopped states.
- Paused state warning.
- Stuck progress timer.
- Hotend/bed target sanity during active print.
- Filament sensor hints.
- Camera availability hints.
- Dark/low-contrast frame checks.
- Fine-edge/stringing-like frame checks.
- Vision model classification.

Ollama settings live under:

```text
Settings → Portal AI
```

Typical Ollama URL:

```text
http://192.168.1.24:11434
```

Related controls:

| Control | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Load Models** | Fetch installed Ollama models from `/api/tags`. |
| **Test** | Check that the selected model is reachable. |
| **Pull** | Request model download through Ollama. |
| **Analyze Camera Now** | Manually trigger a one-shot vision check during an active print. |
| **Treat benign uncertainty as OK** | Downgrade uncertain/no-evidence responses instead of warning loudly. |

---

## AI feedback and false-alarm suppression

Feedback buttons:

- **Looks Good**
- **Looks Bad**
- **False Alarm**

Feedback records are saved to:

```text
data/ai_feedback.jsonl
data/ai_feedback_frames/<printer_id>/
data/ai_feedback_suppressions.json
```

When feedback is clicked, cc2-dash-lite tries to capture a fresh frame. If that fails, it falls back to the latest cached frame.

Feedback is interpreted against what Portal AI believed at the time:

| AI state | User feedback | Interpreted outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Warning | Looks Bad | True positive |
| Warning | Looks Good / False Alarm | False positive |
| OK | Looks Bad | False negative |
| OK | Looks Good | True negative |

False-positive feedback can create a temporary suppression for similar low/severity warnings on the same active print. This helps stop repeated “same thing again” warnings without changing your manual heuristic thresholds.

Review endpoints:

```text
GET /api/ai/feedback/recent
GET /api/ai/feedback/stats
GET /api/ai/feedback/suppressions
```

Manual threshold values remain manual. Feedback suppression does not silently rewrite your dark-frame or fine-edge thresholds.

---

## File Manager

The File Manager is available but hidden by default.

Enable it here:

```text
Settings → Menu / Features → File Manager
```

Sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Printer Files** | Stock-style local printer file list. |
| **USB Drive** | Stock-style USB/u-disk file list with folder navigation. |
| **Print History** | Print history records where firmware reports them. |
| **Video List** | Timelapse/video records derived from stock history/video metadata. |

Stock command IDs used include:

```text
1036  Get history task
1037  Get history task detail
1038  Delete history
1044  Get file list
1045  Get file thumbnail
1046  Get file detail
1047  Delete file
1051  Get/export timelapse video list
```

> [!CAUTION]
> The stock firmware may not reliably generate/export timelapse videos even when the stock portal shows the UI. cc2-dash-lite includes a proxy for the stock `/download` flow, but it cannot fix firmware-side export failures.

---

## Filament Manager / CANVAS controls

The Filament Manager is available but hidden by default while real-printer behavior is tested.

Enable it here:

```text
Settings → Menu / Features → Filament Manager
```

Current CANVAS/MMS features:

- Read CANVAS status.
- Display filament slot cards.
- Display color swatches.
- Display filament metadata where firmware reports it.
- Display filament sensor state with improved normalization.
- Slot layout order: **1, 4, 2, 3**.
- Load/feed selected slot.
- Unload selected slot.
- Edit selected filament profile.
- Toggle Auto Filament Refill.
- Refresh from printer after edit/load/unload/refill changes.
- Lock load/unload/edit controls unless the printer is idle.

Stock command IDs used include:

```text
2001  Load/feed filament
2002  Unload filament
2003  Edit CANVAS filament info
2004  Auto Filament Refill
2005  Get CANVAS status
1055  Set mono filament info
1061  Get mono filament info
```

> [!WARNING]
> Filament load/unload physically moves filament. Keep eyes on the printer while testing. The UI blocks these actions during active prints, but firmware behavior still deserves adult supervision and possibly a stern look.

---

## Stock Elegoo portal bridge

Routes:

```text
/portal-fullscreen
/portal
/elegoo/octo_portal.html
```

Local MQTT WebSocket bridge:

```text
/ws/mqtt/<printer_id>
```

The bridge shuttles browser WebSocket MQTT frames to the printer's MQTT port, usually `1883`.

The stock portal remains the fallback/reference view. If a cc2-dash-lite feature is experimental or firmware-specific, compare behavior against the stock portal.

---

## Themes and appearance

Themes live in:

```text
cc2_dash_lite/themes.py
```

Current built-in themes:

| Theme | Style |
|---|---|
| Octo Dark Blue | Clean dark blue dashboard |
| Amber Terminal | Warm terminal / CRT-ish style |
| Mainsail-ish Dark | Familiar printer-dashboard dark UI |
| Carbon Glass | Dark translucent glass panels |
| Toxic Green Lab | Green terminal/lab console vibe |
| Blood Red Terminal | Red horror-terminal look |
| Elegoo Dark | Closer to stock portal colors |
| Klipper Blue | Blue printer-dashboard theme |
| OLED Mono | Minimal black/white high readability |
| Cyberpunk Magenta | Neon magenta/cyan chaos, in a good way |
| High Contrast | Accessibility-focused contrast |

Theme preview cards are available in:

```text
Setup wizard → UI step
Settings → Theme + Fonts
```

Font stacks are CSS-based. No font files are bundled.

---

## Logs and diagnostics

Logs page:

```text
/logs
```

Persisted log file:

```text
data/logs/system.jsonl
```

Common log sources:

```text
system
app
setup
settings
scanner
command

```

Useful diagnostics:

```text
GET /health
GET /api/version
GET /api/status
GET /api/ai/monitor
GET /api/camera/status
```

---

## Safety gates and command behavior

Per-printer command permissions are configured in:

```text
Settings → Printer Manager
```

There are two important permission layers:

| Permission | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Commands enabled | Allows normal printer command actions. |
| Dangerous commands enabled | Allows riskier actions such as cancel/delete/start-style operations. |

Current command mapping summary:

| Feature | Method / behavior |
|---|---|
| File listing/history | `1036`, `1037`, `1044`, `1046`, `1051` |
| File/history delete | `1038`, `1047` |
| Filament Manager | `2001`, `2002`, `2003`, `2004`, `2005`, `1055`, `1061` |
| Light toggle | `1029` |
| Pause print | `1021` |
| Resume print | `1023` |
| Cancel print | `1022` |
| Camera wake/enable | `1042` / `1054` |
| Speed preset | `1031` with mode `0-3` |
| Analyze Camera Now | Server-side advisory vision check only |

Speed preset modes:

| Mode | Label |
|---:|---|
| `0` | Silent |
| `1` | Balanced |
| `2` | Sport |
| `3` | Ludicrous / Frenzy |

Again: Portal AI does not automatically trigger pause/cancel in this version.

---

## Configuration and data paths

Default runtime data folder:

```text
./data/
```

Important files:

```text
data/config.json
data/logs/system.jsonl
data/vision/<printer_id>/latest.jpg
data/ai_feedback.jsonl
data/ai_feedback_frames/<printer_id>/
data/ai_feedback_suppressions.json
```

Useful environment variables:

```bash
export CC2_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data
export CC2_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json
export CC2_PORT=8088
```

Default access allowlist:

```text

## Troubleshooting

### The dashboard will not start

Run:

```bash
./install.sh
./run.sh
```

If using systemd:

```bash
sudo systemctl status cc2-dash-lite --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u cc2-dash-lite -f
```

### Browser cannot reach the dashboard

Check:

1. Pi IP address.
2. Port, default `8088`.
3. Firewall/router rules.
4. cc2-dash-lite access allowlist.
5. Whether the service is running.

### Scan does not find the printer

Try:

1. Confirm the printer is powered on.
2. Confirm the Pi and printer are on the same LAN/subnet.
3. Try direct printer IP in setup/manual add.
4. Confirm printer serial/SN and access code.
5. Check **Logs → scanner**.

The scan UI only shows verified Centauri responses. A generic open web port does not count.

### Stock portal opens but does not control the printer

Check:

1. Printer serial/SN.
2. PIN/access code.
3. MQTT port, usually `1883`.
4. Printer Manager command toggles.
5. Browser console.
6. **Logs → command**.

### Camera stream is flaky

Try:

1. Enable Camera Relay.
2. Restart the camera relay from Settings or API.
3. Close other direct camera viewers.
4. Avoid opening printer `:8080` directly in multiple tabs.
5. Check `/api/camera/status`.

### Ollama model list does not load

Check:

1. Ollama is running.
2. The URL includes protocol and port, for example `http://192.168.1.24:11434`.
3. The Pi can reach the Ollama host.
4. The selected vision model is installed.

### Portal AI does nothing while idle

That is expected. Current behavior is active-print-only monitoring. The loop still wakes lightly to check status so it can resume when a print starts, but it avoids heavy AI/vision work while idle.

### File Manager video download/export fails

If the stock Elegoo portal also fails, the problem is probably firmware-side. cc2-dash-lite includes the stock-style command path and download proxy, but it cannot force the printer firmware to generate a missing timelapse file.

### Filament sensor says unknown

The app normalizes several known stock/raw sensor paths, but firmware may report different shapes depending on mode, CANVAS state, or printer firmware. Check **Logs → filament** and compare against the stock portal.

---

## Known limitations

- Private/hobby LAN use only; not production-hardened.
- Windows is untested.
- AI/vision monitoring is advisory only.
- AI does not automatically pause/cancel jobs in this version.
- Vision checks can produce false positives and false negatives.
- Camera quality, lighting, glare, focus, and angle matter a lot.
- Firmware response shapes may vary by version.
- Timelapse/video export may not work even in the stock portal.
- File Manager and Filament Manager remain firmware-sensitive.
- No frontend build is required, but this also means the UI is intentionally simple and dependency-light.

---

## Uninstall

Remove the service while keeping local data:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

Remove service plus `.venv` and `data/`:

```bash
./uninstall.sh --purge
```

> [!CAUTION]
> `--purge` deletes local configuration, logs, vision frames, and AI feedback data.

## Release notes

### v1.2.33 dashboard metrics and G-code thumbnails

- Dashboard Print Status now attempts to populate **Filament Used** from additional stock/firmware field names including `totalFilamentUsed`, material weight, and filament length aliases. If firmware does not publish a usable value, the UI still shows `-` rather than inventing one.
- Expanded Print Status now shows layer progress when available, such as `120/450`.
- Added optional dashboard G-code thumbnail preview for the active file. The preview only appears when the printer returns a usable thumbnail image.
- Clicking the thumbnail opens a larger themed glass modal with a close button.
- Added **Settings → Dashboard Layout → G-code thumbnail preview** to show/hide the thumbnail section.

### v1.2.32 crt themes

- Added two new built-in retro monitor themes: **Retro CRT Blue-Gray** and **Green Phosphor CRT**.
- Both themes use the built-in **Retro CRT** font stack with scanline/glow styling for an old-monitor feel.
- Theme preview cards in Settings and first-run setup now include the two new CRT-style themes.

### v1.2.31 theme expansion

- Added six built-in themes: **Toxic Green Lab**, **Blood Red Terminal**, **Elegoo Dark**, **Klipper Blue**, **OLED Mono**, and **Cyberpunk Magenta**.
- Added clickable theme preview cards to Settings and first-run setup.
- Existing theme/font override behavior is preserved.

### v1.2.30 filament polish

- Reordered CANVAS slot display to **1, 4, 2, 3**.
- Added refresh-after-action behavior for edit/load/unload/Auto Refill.

- Added backend rejection while printing or during filament/extruder operation states.
- Improved Auto Filament Refill behavior using the stock payload.

- Converted export-returned video paths/tokens into dashboard download links.

## Development checks

No frontend build step is required for normal use.

After edits, useful checks are:

```bash
python -m compileall cc2_dash_lite
python - <<'PY'
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader
from pathlib import Path

env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('templates'))
for path in Path('templates').glob('*.html'):
    env.get_template(path.name)
print('templates ok')
PY
node --check static/app.js
```

The Node check is optional and only verifies JavaScript syntax if Node is installed.
